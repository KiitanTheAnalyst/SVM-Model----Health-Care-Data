# SVM-Model----Health-Care
This project focuses on building a support vector machine project that can accurately predict if a patient has a benign or malignant tumor

## Dataset Information
This Dataset contains 10 fields of information about patients. The characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.
The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4). This will help determine if patients have growth that could lead to breast cancer or not. A benign condition refers to a tumor or growth that is not cancerous. A malignant condition refers to a tumor or growth that is cancerous.
